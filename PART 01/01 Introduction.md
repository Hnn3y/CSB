# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity can be defined as a collection of defensive processes, technologies, and practices specifically designed to protect internet-connected systems—particularly the software operating on these systems. Traditional cyber defense mechanisms include firewalls, authentication tools, and network monitoring software that detect, track, and block malicious activities like viruses, malware, and cyber intrusions. These solutions form a protective shield for digital infrastructure.

However, many threats originate from vulnerabilities in applications—typically caused by bugs in software design and implementation. Although patches and security updates are continually developed, attackers persistently exploit newly discovered flaws. As a result, the cyber threat landscape is continuously evolving.

### The Evolving Threat Landscape

Building defenses solely against known attacks is no longer sufficient. Emerging threats demand advanced techniques to detect hidden or embedded intrusions. As cybersecurity continues to evolve, machine learning and data mining are becoming vital tools in identifying and mitigating sophisticated attacks.

### Key Questions in Cybersecurity

Security is essential in a world where software pervades nearly every aspect of life. Although it is difficult to achieve perfect security, several methodologies exist to help answer critical security questions:

- **What is being protected?**
- **Are there known threats or vulnerabilities?**
- **What are the consequences of data loss or leakage?**
- **What is the value of the data or system?**
- **What actions can be taken to mitigate these risks?**

### Terminology Overview

| Term           | Definition |
|----------------|------------|
| **Asset**      | Anything of value that needs protection. Can be tangible (e.g., servers, devices) or intangible (e.g., data). |
| **Threat**     | A potential cause of an unwanted incident. In cybersecurity, it typically refers to a malicious actor or action targeting an asset. |
| **Vulnerability** | A flaw or weakness in a system—such as a coding error, design flaw, misconfiguration, or user mistake—that can be exploited. |
| **Exploit**    | A specific method or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability. This includes both technical methods and social engineering. |

### Understanding Risk

A perfect defense system is practically impossible. The objective is to find a balance between the acceptable level of risk and the resources spent on mitigating threats. While risk can be minimized, it cannot be entirely eliminated.

## Quiz: Denial of Service Attack

**Points Earned:** 1/1  
**Deadline:** August 31, 2025, 9:59 PM

**Question:**  
Some years ago, a Denial of Service (DoS) attack was performed against Dyn, a major DNS provider. This was reported in the news, for example, [here](http://gizmodo.com/this-is-probably-why-half-the-internet-shut-down-today-1788062835).

**What made this attack so powerful when compared to previous similar attacks?**
